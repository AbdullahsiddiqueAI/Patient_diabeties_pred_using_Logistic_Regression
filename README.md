# Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression
This project involves predicting whether a person has diabetes based on various medical attributes using a Logistic Regression model. The dataset used is the PIMA Diabetes Dataset from Kaggle, which contains several features related to the medical history and condition of patients.

# Dataset
The dataset can be found on Kaggle at the following link:
[Diabetes Dataset CSV](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/diabetescsv)

# Data Collection and Analysis
Loading the Data
The data is loaded from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.

# Exploring the Data
The first few rows of the DataFrame are printed to get an overview of the dataset.
The shape of the dataset is checked to understand the number of rows and columns.
Statistical measures of the data are obtained to understand the distribution and central tendency.
The distribution of the 'Outcome' column is analyzed to see the balance between diabetic and non-diabetic cases.
Data Grouping
The dataset is grouped by the 'Outcome' column to calculate the mean values for each feature, segregated by diabetic and non-diabetic cases.

# Data Preprocessing
Separating Features and Target
The features (all columns except 'Outcome') and the target ('Outcome') are separated into different variables.

# Data Standardization
The features are standardized using StandardScaler to normalize the data, which helps in improving the performance of the logistic regression model.

# Train-Test Split
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model.

# Model Training
Training the Logistic Regression Model
A custom Logistic Regression model from the Log_Reg module is used. The model is trained using the training data with a specified learning rate and number of iterations.

# Model Evaluation
Accuracy Score
The accuracy of the model is evaluated on both the training data and the test data. The accuracy scores provide an indication of how well the model is performing.

# Making a Predictive System
Predicting Diabetes for a New Data Instance
A new data instance is provided to the model to predict whether the person is diabetic or not. The data is transformed, standardized, and then passed to the model for prediction.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of training a Logistic Regression model to predict diabetes based on various medical attributes. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy scores on both training and test data, and predictions can be made for new data instances.
